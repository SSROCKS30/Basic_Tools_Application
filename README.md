# Java Swing Project

This is a Java Swing project that provides a simple home page with three options:

1. Calculator
2. BMI Calculator
3. Quadratic Solver


## Introduction

This Java Swing project aims to create a user-friendly interface with three different functionalities: a basic calculator, BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator, and a quadratic equation solver.

## Features

1. **Calculator:** Perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

2. **BMI Calculator:** Calculate Body Mass Index based on user input of height and weight.

3. **Quadratic Solver:** Solve quadratic equations by entering coefficients.


## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- HomePage.java: Main class for the home page with Swing components.

- CalculatorPanel.java: Class for the calculator functionality.

- BMICalculatorPanel.java: Class for the BMI calculator functionality.

- QuadraticSolverPanel.java: Class for the quadratic equation solver functionality.

Feel free to explore and modify the code according to your requirements.
